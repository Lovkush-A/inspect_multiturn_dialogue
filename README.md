Aim of this repository is to create evals for multi-turn dialogues, using AISI's inspect framework.

## Repository structure
- `multi_dialogues.ipynb`. Main file for this repository. Contains example eval workflow.
- `question.jsonl`. Example dialogue evals copied from [MT Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/llm_judge/data/mt_bench/question.jsonl).
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` - standard files for a github repo.

## Contributions
Issues or pull requests are welcome.
Also happy to hear from people who want to collaborate to flesh out the toy example to make this more reusable and flexible.
